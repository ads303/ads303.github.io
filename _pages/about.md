Welcome to my site! I am a **Human Genetics PhD student** at the University of Pittsburgh's Dept. of Human Genetics in the School of Public Health. I currently work as a member of [Dr. HJ Park's lab](http://parklab.pitt.edu/members.html), in which I am focusing on using machine learning and causal inference methods to better understand complex genetic diseases. Specifically, I am **developing statistical methods for large-scale databases to better elucidate risk factors for complex disease**. A few of the papers in the last year that I'm excited about include: [**Epstein-Barr Virus Seropositivity, Immune Dysregulation, and Mortality in Pediatric Sepsis**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837768) published in [_JAMA Network Open_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen), [**DeepDiff-SHAP: Interpretable deep learning for subgroup-specific causal inference using conditional SHAP**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.14.670190v1) hosted on the **bioRxiv** preprint server, and [**DeepEXPOKE: A Deep Learning Framework with Polygenic Risk Scores as Knockoffs for Deconvoluting Genetic and Non-Genetic Exposure Risks in Sepsis and Coronary Heart Disease**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.15.24315572v1), currently in the revision stage at [_Genome Medicine_](http://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/) and hosted on the **medRxiv** preprint server. 
 
I received my M.S. in **Genetic Epidemiology** from the University of Washington, Seattle in June 2022. As part of my Master's thesis working with Dr. Kathleen Kerr, I investigated [**genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in multiethnic populations**](https://www.iomcworld.org/articles/genetic-risk-factors-associated-with-sarscov2-susceptibility-in-multiethnic-populations.pdf).  

In the summer of 2021, I worked as a visiting research intern at UCSF with Dr. Lauren Weiss's group and Dr. Helen Kim's group on two unique complex genetic disease research projects. With Dr. Weiss, I investigated the hypothesis that maternal asthma can be a predictor of autism in children; I worked on developing polygenic risk scores and using risk scores as a metric for disease prediction and prevention. With Dr. Kim, I investigated the genetic basis of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). Our research group ended up publishing the following manuscript in _Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology_: [**Mild Hypoxia Accelerates Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Disease Through CX3CR1-CX3CL1 Signaling**](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.320367). You can find more information about the scope of these projects and my prior undergraduate research experience in [my CV](https://ads303.github.io/cv/). 

I received my B.S. in **Genetics and Genomics** from the University of California, Davis along with a **minor in Statistics** in June 2020. I credit a lot of my scientific curiosity and appreciation for research to my time working in [Dr. Megan Dennis's lab](https://www.dennislab.org/) and the wonderful mentors (Dr. Alexandra Col√≥n-Rodriguez, Dr. Megan Dennis) I had. From 2018-2020, I studied autism spectrum disorder in zebrafish and contributed to the following manuscript in _Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology_: [Assessment of Autism Zebrafish Mutant Models Using a High-Throughput Larval Phenotyping Platform](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.586296/full#h8).

Away from the lab, my hobbies include analysis and written work about the NBA, playing the piano and drums, basketball, tennis, nature photography, and all things coffee. 

If you have any questions about my research or career path, feel free to send me an email at: [ads303@pitt.edu](mailto:ads303@pitt.edu). 

Thanks for stopping by!
