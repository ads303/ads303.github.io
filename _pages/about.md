I'm an incoming MSTP (MD-PhD) student at Stanford University. 

From 2018-2022, I was a volunteer/staff research associate in the Butte laboratory, working on T cell biology and clinical immunology. I graduated with my BS from UCLA in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics in December of 2020. Quite a mouthful, I know. If you want some specifics, they're listed in my CV [here](https://humzalikhan.github.io/cv/). 

I spent my time at UCLA performing both basic science and computational immunology research. I created a [list of candidate immmunodeficiency genes](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07909-3) which is now used in the rare immune disease clinic at UCLA and at other inborn error of immunity clinics worldwide. I also studied Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) using high-throughput proteomics and genomicsâ€“this project is now in preparation for a first-author publication.

Some other things I care about, in no particular order, are: mentorship to underserved populations (especially in STEM), reproducibility in science, photography, reading, scrolling endlessly through Wikipedia, and (failing at) the harmonica.

If you're interested in any of this, go ahead and take a look around or shoot me a line via email.
