Welcome to my site! I am a Human Genetics PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. I currently work as a member of Dr. HJ Park's lab, in which I am focusing on using machine learning and causal inference methods to better understand complex genetic diseases. 

From 2020-2022, I spent a majority of my time looking into [genetic factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.23.22276797v1.full-text) as part of my graduate school thesis project. I received my M.S. degree from the University of Washington, Seattle in Genetic Epidemiology in June of 2022. In June of 2020, I received my B.S. in Genetics and Genomics from the University of California, Davis along with a minor in Statistics. 

All of my graduate school research has been computationally driven, and has involved statistical genetics and deep learning methods. In the summer of 2021, I worked at UCSF with Dr. Lauren Weiss's group and Dr. Helen Kim's group on two separate complex genetic disease projects. With Dr. Weiss, I investigated the hypothesis that maternal asthma can be a predictor of autism in children; I worked extensively with polygenic risk scores and using risk scores as a metric for disease prediction and prevention. With Dr. Kim, I investigated the genetic basis of cerebral cavernous malformations. You can find more information about these projects and my prior research experience in my CV. 

Besides my research, my hobbies include covering and writing about the NBA, producing music, playing sports any chance I can get, and working on making the perfect cup of espresso.
