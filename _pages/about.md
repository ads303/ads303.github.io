Welcome to my site! I am a **Human Genetics PhD student** at the University of Pittsburgh. I currently work as a member of [Dr. HJ Park's lab](http://parklab.pitt.edu/members.html), in which I am focusing on using machine learning and causal inference methods to better understand complex genetic diseases. Specifically, I am **developing statistical methods for large-scale databases to better elucidate risk factors for complex disease**. 

From 2021-2022, I investigated [genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in multiethnic populations](https://www.iomcworld.org/articles/genetic-risk-factors-associated-with-sarscov2-susceptibility-in-multiethnic-populations.pdf) as part of my Master's thesis research. I received my M.S. degree from the University of Washington, Seattle in **Genetic Epidemiology** in June of 2022. In June of 2020, I received my B.S. in **Genetics and Genomics** from the University of California, Davis along with a **minor in Statistics**. 

All of my graduate school research experiences have been computationally based; topics relavant to my research include statistical genetics, computational genomics, and deep learning methods. In the summer of 2021, I worked at UCSF with Dr. Lauren Weiss's group and Dr. Helen Kim's group on two separate complex genetic disease research projects. With Dr. Weiss, I investigated the hypothesis that maternal asthma can be a predictor of autism in children; I worked on developing polygenic risk scores and using risk scores as a metric for disease prediction and prevention. With Dr. Kim, I investigated the genetic basis of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). You can find more information about the scope of these projects and my prior undergraduate research experience in [my CV](https://ads303.github.io/cv/). 

Besides my research, my hobbies include covering and writing about the NBA, producing music, playing sports any chance I can get, and working on making the perfect cup of espresso.    

If there's something you want to ask me or if you have any questions about my research/career path, feel free to send me an email at: [ads303@pitt.edu](mailto:ads303@pitt.edu). 

Thanks for stopping by!
