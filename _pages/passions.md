Outside of science, here's some things I enjoy doing.

**Mentorship**
======

Much of my personal fulfillment comes from discussing with people who (for some reason) want my advice. 

In [The XPeriment](https://www.thebruinexperiment.com/), I've gotten the kids I mentor excited about science. The yearly science fairs are some of my best memories and represent the culimination of diligence and hard work on the part of the students. I try to be a wall that they can lean on, but I ardently support letting them struggle just enough to figure out their projects and learn something.

As an [Irvington High School (IHS) alumni mentor](https://ihsvikings.org/alumni), I've talked to tens of students about the paths that they want to pursue and where they want to go. I'm just a college senior, so I help how I can. 

Even if you're not an LA middle schooler or an IHS student, I'd be happy to chat about pursuing research as an undergraduate or college admissions/major planning. 

I don't charge, nor do I bite.

**Reading**
======

My fondest memories of childhood are biking to a nearby park, sitting down under a tree, and reading. Childhood favorites of mine are *The Giver*, *Oh, The Places You'll Go*, and *Calvin and Hobbes*.

Current favorites of mine include (but are not limited to) *Being Mortal* by Atul Gawande, *The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down* by Anne Fadiman, and anything by Kurt Vonnegut (*Mother Night* is a favorite). 

If you have a good book recommendation of any genre, I'm more than happy to hear about it.

**Hiking**
======

I'm a trip lead in UCLA's Peaks and Professors. We coordinate and lead hikes with faculty and students to make the 30,000+ population of UCLA seem a bit smaller.
