Some of my passion projects away from the lab:

**Locked In Podcast (NBA, NFL, and all things sports)**
======

My childhood friend Ani and I have always had scintillating discussions about the sports world. During the COVID-19 global pandemic required quarantine period sometime in April 2020, we decided that there was no point in us keeping our thoughts to ourselves. We started a sports podcast, have had a number of amazing sports personalities appear on our show, and continue to talk about the players and teams that we both love. Give it a listen [here!](https://open.spotify.com/show/756gJjzfV7YAlMP8vTHUHU?si=aff5c0d130d041ae)

**Music Production**
======

I've loved playing the piano and drums since I was around 5 years old, and I've composed, mixed, and produced some music over the years. Check out my songs and production breakdowns in the first three tabs [here!](https://linktr.ee/adityasriram)
