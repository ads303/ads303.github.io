Research
======

* **Butte Lab**  
  *Undergraduate Researcher* 
  
  February 2018-April 2022
  
  *Common Variable Immunodeficiency*
  * Utilized Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) as a methodology to establish functional cellular differences in patients     with CVID
  * Optimized assay to measure phospho-protein levels in immunodeficiency patients
  * Creating a novel 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model methodology to analyze CyTOF signaling data
  * Making machine learning models to correlate signaling, exome data with clinical phenotype in CVID
  
  *Candidate Variants for Inborn Errors of Immunity*
  * Utilized the OmniPath meta-database to find variants functionally related to known IEI genes
  * Produced comprehensive list of IEI-related genes for novel IEI gene discovery in the clinic
  * Creating an R Shiny Webapp to functionalize variants filtering for clinicians
  
  *Adducin and CD4 T Cell Costimulation*
  
  * Utilized confocal microscopy and ImageJ to link the actin capping protein Alpha-Adducin to CD4 T-cell 
    costimulation
  * Used R to fit logistic regression curves for dose-responsive T-cell proliferation curves
  
  *Basophil Activation Test*
  
  * Worked to optimize a high-throughput assay to diagnose allergy
  * Mentored a high school student in the summer of 2018
  
*  **Bruins in Genomics Summer Research Fellowship**	             	       
   *Undergraduate Researcher*
   
   June 2020-Present
