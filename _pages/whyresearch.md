Welcome to my journey as a PhD student! My research interests are centered around translational genetic and genomic research. The most rewarding aspect of biological research is seeing how complex computational and statistical analyses correspond to real-world clinical decision making. I hope to bridge gaps in my understanding of genetic diseases and improve the lives of many through my work over the next 4+ years.
